=YARDWiz - Yet Another Recording Downloader for the Wiz=

==Introduction==
YARDWiz is a simple GUI front end for prl's getWizPnP prgram.  getWizPnP is a command line program allows that you (among other things) to list and download recordings from a Beyonwiz DP series PVR over the network using the WizPnP interface. It draws a lot of inspiration from the Two Wizards WizZilla software, though YARDWiz is simpler in functionality and design.

I wrote YARDWiz as I wanted a simple getWinPnP GUI that ran on my Linux laptop.

==Current Release 0.2.0===

==Requirements==
YARDWiz has been tested successfully on Windows 7 Pro, Ubuntu 10.04 and 10.10 (32 bit only so far) with python 2.6, wxPython 2.8 & 2.9, and getWizPnP 0.4.3a. It should work on Windows XP/Vista and other linux flavours. I have no access to a Mac, so no idea if it will run on one.

===_Windows_===
A windows installer is now available which is self contained and doesn't require the installation of python, wxpython or getWizPnP.

===_From source_===
Before running you will need to install the following software:
  * python >=2.6 and < 3.0  (http://www.python.org)
  * wxpython 2.8+  (http://www.wxpython.org)
  * getWizPnP   (http://www.openwiz.org/wiki/GetWizPnP_Release)
    * Windows: download the pre-compiled Windows executable version and save getWizPnP.exe somewhere in your PATH
    * Linux: install the perl package from source as per the installation notes in getWizPnP README.txt

==Installation==

===_Windows_===
Run the windows installer, this is self contained and doesn't require the prior installation of python, wxpython or getWizPnP.

===_From source_===
Currently no other OS specific installers have been created, just a simple python setupy.py script. 
To install, unzip the source archive, then:
  * Windows - run install.bat (you _may_ need to run it as Administrator).
  * Linux - sudo python setupy.py install

For easy access to the application, I just create shortcuts in my Windows Start Menu/Linux Gnome Menu:
  * Windows: create a shortcut to <python dir>\pythonw.exe <python dir>\Scripts\yardwiz
             E.G. C:\Python26\pythonw.exe C:\Python26\Scripts\yardwiz
  * Linux: create a desktop/menu launcher to /usr/local/bin/yardwiz
    
To bling up your shortcut/launcher, there is an icon in the yardwizgui\icons folder.
  
To uninstall (assuming you still have a copy of the source :):
  * Windows - run uninstall.bat (you _may_ need to run it as Administrator).
  * Linux - sudo python setupy.py uninstall
        
==Known issues==
 * If you modify the default getwizpnp.conf (Windows) or .getwizpnp (Linux/Mac) you may break YARDWiz. In particular, GetWizPnP's date format is hardcoded into YARDWiz.
 * On Windows when running from pythonw.exe, the getwizpnp.exe subprocess has proven troublesome to kill (i.e if you want to pause or stop a download). I've had to fallback to using the taskkill.exe program that is included in most recent versions of Windows (XP and later). Taskkill.exe is _not_ included in Windows XP Home edition and I don't know if it is included in Windows Vista/7 basic/home/starter editions. If this is an issue, an alternative is to download PsTools.zip from http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896683 and extract PsKill.exe to somewhere on your PATH. YARDWiz will then attempt to use pskill instead.
 * After discovering Wizzes, the Wiz device ComboBox does not respond to keyboard input again until an item is selected from the dropdown list.
 * The app really should use a lawnmower icon...
