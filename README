=YARDWiz - Yet Another Recording Downloader for the Wiz=

==Introduction==
YARDWiz is a simple crossplatform GUI front end for prl's getWizPnP prgram.  getWizPnP is a command line program that allows you (among other things) to list and download recordings from a Beyonwiz DP series PVR over the network using the WizPnP interface. It draws a lot of inspiration from the Two Wizards WizZilla software, though YARDWiz is simpler in functionality and design.

I wrote YARDWiz as I wanted a simple getWinPnP GUI that ran on my Linux laptop.

==Requirements==
YARDWiz has been tested successfully on Windows 7 Pro, Windows XP Pro, Ubuntu 10.04 and 10.10 and Mac OSX 10.6.2 with python 2.6, wxPython 2.8 and getWizPnP 0.4.3a. It should work on Windows Vista and other linux flavours.

===_Windows_===
A windows installer is now available which is self contained and doesn't require the installation of python, wxpython or getWizPnP.

===_OSX_===
An OSX application is now available which is self contained and doesn't require the installation of python, wxpython or getWizPnP.

===_From source_===
Before running you will need to install the following software:
  * python >=2.6 and < 3.0  (http://www.python.org)
  * wxpython 2.8+  (http://www.wxpython.org)
  * getWizPnP   (http://www.openwiz.org/wiki/GetWizPnP_Release)
    * Windows: download the pre-compiled Windows executable version and save getWizPnP.exe somewhere in your PATH
    * Linux & OSX: install the perl package from source as per the installation notes in getWizPnP README.txt

==Installation==

===_Windows_===
Run the windows installer, this is self contained and doesn't require the prior installation of python, wxpython or getWizPnP.

===_OSX_===
Mount the disk image (.dmg) and drag the YARDWiz app to your applications folder.

===_From source_===
Currently no other OS specific installers have been created, just a simple python setup.py script. To install, unzip the source archive, then:
  * Windows - run `install.bat` (you _may_ need to run it as Administrator).
  * Linux & OSX - `sudo python setup.py install`

For easy access to the application, setup.py creates shortcuts in the Windows Start Menu/Linux Gnome Menu. Or on Linux and OSX, you can just type 'yardwiz' in a terminal.

==Uninstalling==
===Uninstalling on Windows===
Run the windows uninstaller.

===Uninstalling on OSX===
Delete the YARDWiz app from your applications folder.

===When installed from source===
To uninstall (assuming you still have a copy of the source :):
  * Windows - run `uninstall.bat` (you _may_ need to run it as Administrator).
  * Linux & OSX - `sudo python setup.py uninstall`
 
==Known issues==
 * If you modify the default getwizpnp.conf (Windows) or .getwizpnp (Linux/Mac) you may break YARDWiz.
 * On Windows when running from pythonw.exe, the getwizpnp.exe subprocess has proven troublesome to kill (i.e if you want to pause or stop a download). I've had to fallback to using the taskkill.exe program that is included in most recent versions of Windows (XP and later). Taskkill.exe is _not_ included in Windows XP Home edition and I don't know if it is included in Windows Vista/7 basic/home/starter editions. If this is an issue, an alternative is to download PsTools.zip from http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896683 and extract PsKill.exe to somewhere on your PATH. YARDWiz will then attempt to use pskill instead.
 * wx.Sound does not seem to work on Ubuntu 10.10 (that may be my virtual environment though...)
 * The app really should use a lawnmower icon...
